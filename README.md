# Crypto-tracker

Crypto-Tracker is a minimal project which was built from Platzi's Introduction to React Native course.  This project aims to put into practice the knowledge in React Native, following good practices in building software.

The project consumes an API-REST published at  [CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api "CoinLore") and displays cryptocurrency information such as:
- Coin name
- Logo
- Current value
- Price variation in the last 24 hours
- Others.

This information is displayed in the mobile application built in React Native, for which the following components were used:

- Stack navigator
- Vertical Flat List
- Horizontal Flat List
- Fetch
